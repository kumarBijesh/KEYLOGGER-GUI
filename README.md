This is a keylogger tool that records all keystrokes typed on a computer. It comes with a simple graphical user interface (GUI), making it easy to use. I’m currently working on an advanced version that can start automatically and securely send captured keystrokes to a designated email address.

This tool is primarily intended for responsible uses, such as:

  Allowing parents to monitor their children’s computer activities.

  Helping schools oversee computer usage in labs to ensure appropriate behavior.

It’s important to note that this application should only be used with proper consent and for ethical purposes. Unauthorized use to monitor someone without their knowledge may be illegal and unethical.
